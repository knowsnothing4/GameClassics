# Todo

- Make Snake playable and less glitchy.
- Finish Tic Tac Toe.
- Fiix frame size of games, currently not really 800x600 somehow.
- Implement a class to handle animations.
- Create textures and include them in the .jar file
- Make the game run on a separate thread so it can't lock up the manager when bugs occur.
- Create an "Exit" menu option to close the program properly.
- Make a default game manager screen that appears when you close/save a game.
- Show a translucent layer on the screen when games are paused.
- Implement a kind of dynamic BSP-Tree to make collision detection between SceneObjects more efficient.
- Work on sound effects and maybe some beep stuff.
- Make a super cool and simple to use built-in sound engine!
