# Todo

- Fix Snake's collision logic.
- Add textures to Tic Tac Toe and Snake.
- Change the game resolution to better fit with future 64x64 tile textures;
- Create textures and include them in the .jar file
- Create a texture/images direcotry in the project tree.
- Implement a class to handle animations.
- Make the game run on a separate thread so it can't lock up the manager when bugs occur.
- Create an "Exit" menu option to close the program properly.
- Make a default game manager screen that appears when you close/save a game.
- Implement a kind of dynamic BSP-Tree to make collision detection between SceneObjects more efficient.
- Work on sound effects and maybe some beep stuff.
- Make a super cool and simple to use built-in sound engine!
