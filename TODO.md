# Todo
* Implement a kind of dynamic BSP-Tree to make collision detection between SceneObjects more efficient.
* Create an "Exit" menu option
* Handle the stop for GameClassic objects. So they can save scores and switch games.
* Create textures and include them in the .jar file
* Pick a first game and implement it using the engine.
* Make a super cool and simple to use built-in sound engine!
