# Todo

- Start designing a new game: Snake (Probably).
- Make the game run on a separate thread so it can't lock up the manager when bugs occur.
- Create an "Exit" menu option to close the program properly.
- Create textures and include them in the .jar file
- Make a default game manager screen that appears when you close/save a game.
- Show a translucent layer on the screen when games are paused.
- Allow individual game modules to set their own processing fps when they start.
- Implement a kind of dynamic BSP-Tree to make collision detection between SceneObjects more efficient.
- Make a super cool and simple to use built-in sound engine!
