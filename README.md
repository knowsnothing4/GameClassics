# GameClassics
A bunch of classic and popular games in a single java application.

All the games are built on top of a very flexible and simple custom game framework focused on productivity.
The framework adds, removes and moves images as objects on a screen. It also takes care of device events like mouse/keyboard, does collision detection and simple transformations like rotation,scaling and transparency.
It will also provide a good sound engine as well as network access in the future.

Here is a list of games I intend to implement and make available in the final version:
